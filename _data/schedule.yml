  Abstract: The clinical routine has access to an ever-expanding repertoire of diagnostic tests, ranging from routine imaging to sophisticated molecular profiling technologies. Foundation models have recently emerged as powerful tools for extracting and integrating diagnostic information from these diverse clinical tests, advancing the idea of comprehensive patient digital twins. However, it remains unclear how to select and design tests that ensure foundation models can extract the necessary information for accurate diagnosis. We introduce MAVIS (Multi-modal Active VIew Selection), a reinforcement learning framework that unifies modality selection and feature selection into a single decision process. By leveraging foundation models, MAVIS dynamically determines which diagnostic tests to perform and in what sequence, adapting to individual patient characteristics. Experiments on real-world datasets across multiple clinical tasks demonstrate that MAVIS outperforms conventional approaches in both diagnostic accuracy and uncertainty reduction, while reducing testing costs by over 80%, suggesting a promising direction for optimizing clinical workflows through intelligent test design and selection.

  Abstract: Predicting transcriptional responses to novel drugs provides a unique opportunity to accelerate biomedical research and advance drug discovery efforts. However, the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of cellular responses, combined with the extremely limited available experimental data, makes the task challenging. In this study, we leverage single-cell foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on tens of millions of single cells, encompassing multiple cell types, states, and disease annotations, to address molecular perturbation prediction. We introduce a drug-conditional adapter that allows efficient fine-tuning by training less than 1% of the original foundation model, thus enabling molecular conditioning while preserving the rich biological representation learned during pre-training. The proposed strategy allows not only the prediction of cellular responses to novel drugs, but also the zero-shot generalization to unseen cell lines. We establish a robust evaluation framework to assess model performance across different generalization tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results across all settings, with significant improvements in the few-shot and zero-shot generalization to new cell lines compared to existing baselines.

  Abstract: Systematic genetic perturbation provides critical insights into cell functioning, yet predicting their cellular effects remains a major challenge. Despite advances in computational approaches, accurately modelling cellular responses to unseen perturbations continues to be difficult. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in biological applications by synthesizing scientific knowledge, but their direct application to high-dimensional gene expression data has been impractical due to numerical limitations. We propose LangPert, a novel hybrid framework that leverages LLMs to guide a downstream k-nearest neighbors (kNN) aggregator, combining biological reasoning with efficient numerical inference. We demonstrate that LangPert achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-gene perturbation prediction tasks across multiple datasets.

  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to utlilize expert knowledge and simulate human thinking, which potentially makes them instrumental for a variety of scientific tasks. However, since scientific data is heterogeneous, often presented in the form of unordered tables, bridging the gap between unstructured non-textual data and the language processing capabilities of LLMs remains an open challenge. Agentic AI offers a promising approach by enabling LLMs to interactively query datasets for relevant information. Here, we explore the application of this agentic paradigm to single-cell transcriptomic analysis, with a specific focus on cell type annotation. Our results show that when LLMs are equipped with data-querying capabilities, their performance in annotating cell types improves significantly compared to single-shot prompting. Furthermore, we provide a proof of concept illustration of how our method can be used to integrate diverse single-cell datasets (e.g., cell census), ensuring consistent annotation across multiple sources, facilitating meta-analysis across big sample cohorts.
