<p>
Despite rapid advances in data-driven biology, our limited understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying diseases continues to hinder therapeutic innovation. While genomics and multi-omics platforms have generated vast datasets, translating these into actionable biological insights remains an open challenge. At the same time, the emergence of foundation models and AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, and hypothesis generation offers a unique opportunity to reimagine how we approach discovery in biology. The 3rd MLGenX workshop aims to bring together the machine learning, genomics, and biology communities to explore this new frontier. This year’s theme, <strong>From Reasoning to Experimentation: Closing the Loop Between AI Agents and the Biological Lab</strong>, focuses on adaptive, interpretable, and experiment-aware AI systems that learn from feedback and drive biological insight. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, benchmark sharing, and open discussion, MLGenX 2026 aims to chart the path toward lab-in-the-loop science and accelerate innovation in biology and drug discovery.

<p>
MLGenX 2026 invites submissions from researchers at the intersection of machine learning, genomics, and
biological discovery. This year, the workshop will feature four tracks designed to welcome a diverse range
of contributions: the <b>Main Track</b>, the <b>Special Track on Lab-in-the-Loop and Self-Evolving Systems</b>,
the <b>Tiny Papers Track</b>, and a new <b>AI-Generated Track</b>.
By providing dedicated spaces for applied ML in biology, methodological innovation, early-stage ideas,
and AI serving as a primary author, MLGenX 2026 aims to highlight the next frontier of target discovery—
closing the loop between reasoning, experimentation, and adaptation.
</p>

<p><b>Main Track</b></p>
<p>
The Main Track welcomes contributions addressing foundational and applied challenges at the intersection
of machine learning, biology, and genomics. We encourage work on methodological advances as well as
biologically grounded applications that connect predictive modeling to scientific understanding and
therapeutic impact.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Foundation models and agentic AI for biological and multi-omics data</li>
    <li>Causal discovery, mechanistic interpretability, and biologically grounded representations</li>
    <li>Generalizability and uncertainty quantification across biological domains and modalities</li>
    <li>Design and perturbation biology, including gene, cell, and RNA-based therapies</li>
    <li>Cellular communication, tissue organization, and spatial or single-cell modeling</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Special Track on Lab-in-the-Loop and Self-Evolving Systems</b></p>
<p>
This track focuses on AI systems that learn through interaction with experimental feedback—moving from
static predictive models toward adaptive, experiment-aware agents. Topics include lab-in-the-loop
frameworks, active learning with experimental or simulated feedback, and autonomous or self-evolving
agentic systems that iteratively generate, test, and refine biological hypotheses.
</p>

<p><b>Tiny Papers Track</b></p>
<p>
The Tiny Papers Track provides a venue for short (3–4 page) submissions presenting early-stage ideas,
negative results, position papers, or preliminary findings. This track aims to lower the barrier for
participation and highlight creative or exploratory directions. AI-generated papers are not permitted
in this track.
</p>

<p><b>AI-Generated Track</b></p>
<p>
MLGenX 2026 introduces a new AI-Generated Track for submissions where AI systems serve as a substantial
contributor or primary author, under clear human oversight. Papers in this track should align with the
Main Track or Special Track themes and follow standard ICLR formatting guidelines.
Submissions must clearly disclose the role of AI systems and adhere to ICLR policies on large language
model usage and research ethics.
</p>


<h3 class="blackpar_title">Journal Partnership</h3>
<p>
<b>Partnership with <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>.</b>
Top workshop contributions will be eligible for a fast-track review process at
<em>Nature Biotechnology</em>. Participation is optional and offered after acceptance
notifications. Selected authors will be invited to expand evaluations and address
reviewer comments prior to transfer to the journal.
</p>


<h3 class="blackpar_title">Submission Instructions</h3>
<p>
Similar to the main ICLR conference, submissions will be double blind.  
We use <a href="https://openreview.net/">OpenReview</a> to host papers. There is no strict page limit for submissions to the Main Track or the Special Track.
Submissions to the AI-Generated Track must not exceed 8 pages for the main text,
and submissions to the Tiny Papers Track must not exceed 4 pages for the main text.
References and appendices may be of unlimited length.
To prepare your submission, please use the official
<a href="https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2026.zip">ICLR template</a>.
</p>
<p>
Submissions that are identical to versions that have been previously published, or accepted to the main ICLR conference are not allowed. However, papers that cite previous related work by the authors and papers that have appeared on non-peer reviewed websites (like arXiv) do not violate the policy. Submission of the paper to archival repositories such as arXiv is allowed during the review period.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b>
<span style="color: #D2042D">
Authors are permitted to submit works that are currently under review by other venues.
Additionally, accepted workshop papers are non-archival and may be subsequently
published in conferences or journals.
</span>
</p>

<p>
We plan to offer <b>Best Paper</b> Award(s), and exceptional submissions may be selected
for oral presentations. Accepted papers will be featured on the workshop website.
</p>

<p>
<b>Additional Track-Specific Notes:</b>
Submissions to the AI-Generated Track must clearly disclose the role of AI systems and
human contributors and must comply with ICLR policies on large language model usage
and research ethics. AI-generated submissions are not permitted in the Tiny Papers
Track.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
Official reviews are anonymous. Unlike the main conference, submissions and reviews
will not be made public until acceptance.
</p>
